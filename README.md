MariNET: Network Analysis for Longitudinal EHR Data

The shift to digital health records (EHRs) has unlocked new potential in biomedical research—but analyzing this complex, time-dependent data requires innovative tools.

MariNET is a novel R package, which is required for this analysis and can be installed from CRAN. It is based on the use of linear mixed models (LMMs) + network science to:
✔ Model dynamic relationships in EHR data
✔ Handle correlated observations and temporal dependencies
✔ Overcome limitations of traditional methods
